\section{What's a triangle?}
A triangle, or loss triangle, is a way of presenting claims information for non-life insurance. It is centered around the notion that at any given point in time, the final settlement value of a claim may not be known. Claims experience is aggregated along two dimensions- a "loss period" and a "development lag". The term "origin period" is often used for loss period and lag is often referred to as "age".

The mesasure so observed along these two dimensions can be virtually anything. Common measures are the cumulative amount of claim payments or cumulative amount of reported loss.
