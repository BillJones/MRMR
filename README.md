MRMR

Multivariate Regression Model for Reserving

Code to analyze property casualty loss reserves. The focus is on the use of linear models (generalized and OLS) to model loss reserves.

MRMR may now be built as an R package. At a future date, I will see about pushing this to CRAN. Until then, all of the files necessary for building a package are in place.
